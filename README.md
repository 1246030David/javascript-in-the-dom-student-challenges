# JavaScript in the DOM

## Introduction to JavaScript in the browser

Work through these exercises to familiarise yourself with connecting [vanilla JavaScript](https://www.javatpoint.com/what-is-vanilla-javascript) to a HTML document so it can be used in the browser.

These exercises will also teach you:

- selecting elements from the DOM
- different events in the DOM
- handling events in the DOM with JavaScript
- manipulating the DOM with JavaScript

Please [fork this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) into your own so that you can push up your solutions for future reference.

### Recommendation - VS Code & Live Server

I would recommend using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) as your IDE for these challenges. I'd also recommend installing the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) VS Code extension so that you don't have to continually refresh your browser each time you make a code change.

### How are the activities structured?

Each folder represents a single exercise, and should be worked through in order

These exercises are adapted from the wonderful free resources found at [JS Challenger](https://www.jschallenger.com/javascript-dom-exercises), and contain additional suggestions for links to help you find the answers. There are also a couple of challenges of my own thrown in for good measure, too ðŸ˜Ž.

#### Good luck!
