# Working in the DOM: From JavaScript to React

## Introduction

Work through these exercises to familiarise yourself with connecting [vanilla JavaScript](https://www.javatpoint.com/what-is-vanilla-javascript) to a HTML document so it can be used in the browser. Activities 5, 6 and 7 transition from vanilla JavaScript to React.

These exercises will also teach you:

- selecting elements from the DOM
- different events in the DOM
- handling events in the DOM with JavaScript
- manipulating the DOM with JavaScript

Please [fork this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) into your own so that you can push up your solutions for future reference.

### How are the activities structured?

Each folder represents a single exercise, and should be worked through in order

The JS exercises are adapted from the wonderful free resources found at [JS Challenger](https://www.jschallenger.com/javascript-dom-exercises), and contain additional suggestions for links to help you find the answers.

The React exercises are adapted from the ever-brilliant Kent C. Dodds and his [React Fundamentals](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-fundamentals) course.

#### Good luck!
